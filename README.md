### BIG PRACTICE (Optional)
###### Target
- Understand & apply knowledge HTML/CSS/JavaScript (with ES6 syntax)
- Understanding & apply MVC (or any MV model or module concept)
- DOM manipulation, form validation.
- Understand how asynchronous code work & apply in practice (API call or any place we can as mock API in code).
- Get familiar with DevTools (e.g Google Chrome DevTools) for debugging issues (breakpoint, log, etc..).
- Deploy to the hosting (with help from supporter)
### OPEN QUESTIONS:
1. What's difference between Truthy/Falsy vs true/false in JavaScript? Why we should understand Truthy/Falsy in JS world? How differences between equals (==) and strict equals (===)?
2. What's difference between null and undefined?
3. How do you understand about callback function? List some cases we should use callback function.
4. How many types of variable scopes? List some cases we should use this variable scope instead of others. Why we should understand scope?
5. What are higher order function, closures?
6. What is Type Coercion? Which issue you think Type Coercion will help/resolve once you understand it?
7. What is short-circuit evaluation?
8. What are differences between values & references? Any potential issue/bug can occur you can see with reference? Please write down simple example.
9. What is pure function? List out benefit of pure function, and what are you understanding about side effect.
10. Pros and cons mutable and immutable. The array methods (as map, push, pop, forEach, slice, splice, sort, filter) belongs to which one (mutable or immutable)? How different between map and forEach, slice vs splice? List out some reduce use cases.
11. What problem do Object destructuring, and Spread operator resolve?
12. What problem asynchronous resolve? What's callback hell, promise hell in asynchronous chaining call? What's difference between Promise and Async/Await (Compare on chaining asynchronous call, code execution order & handle error syntax)? Is there any relationship you think between promise & async await?
13. List some cases would you choose arrow function instead of regular function and vice versa?
